# c3tools
Collection of personal sets of functions to speed up web development.

To install just `<script src="https://unpkg.com/@c3r38r170/c3tools" type="module"></script>`.

Specifying a version is recommended. [More info about unpkg.](https://unpkg.com/)

By default, `c3tools-min.js` will be loaded (non-module version). You must specify `/c3tools-min.m.js` after the version, for the module version.

For example: `<script src="https://unpkg.com/@c3r38r170/c3tools@1.0.0/c3tools-min.m.js" type="module"></script>`

## TO DO
